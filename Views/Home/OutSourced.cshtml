                <h1 class="margin-t-30 margin-b-20 page-header">Associate Staffing Is Catching Up ! (Economic Times)</h1>
                <div class="outsourced_wraper">

                    <p>The phenomenon of temporary staffing has been the fastest growing human resource trend in India. While industry experts estimate employee leasing to be a $140 billion business worldwide, the domestic staffing industry is yet to boast of such numbers. The scenario is however about to change considering the fact that in the near future 2.5 to 3 pct of the workforce in the country will be hired on a temporary basis.</p>

                    <p>A well-accepted norm a "temp" is a temporary worker with an organization who is on a third-party (staffing company) payroll. Many large Indian organizations are now hiring a part of their workforce from employee leasing firms. The contracts can range from three to six months, and there are no hassles normally associated with recruiting and retaining people.</p>

                    <p>Furthermore, there is a growing trend of outsourcing non-core functions to outsourced staff. These range from accounts, front-desk, sales, marketing and back-end operations. Outsourcing organizations undertake outsourcing for diverse sectors, including telecommunications, FMCGs, manufacturing, banking, retail and IT. Employee leasing companies offer a plethora of staffing solutions to their clients which includes-temporary staffing, temporary to permanent services, long term contract, managed services et al.</p>

                    <p>The trend of temporary staffing has been popularized in India by multinationals who have been aware of the benefits of their experiences in other countries. The advantages are many-flexibility of employment, ease of recruitment and replacements and such staffing companies also take statutory complexities.</p>

                    <p>
                        However there is often a misconception that this is an extended payroll service. The biggest beneficiary of temporary employment in India have been freshers. Furthermore, many employees choose temporary employment as an avenue to exhibit their talents to the client organization, which could be a stepping-stone to a full-time permanent career. Temporary employment has
                        often been an effective entry route into big companies.
                    </p>

                    <p class="margin-b-40">In the near future, temporary staffing is expected to grow exponentially in the country. It is the quality and ease of availability of manpower that would define the role employee leasing organizations stand to play, not only in non-core functions but also certain core business areas of organizations. Therefore, it is imperative for outsourcing partners to move from "only" employee leasing to complete end-to-end activity management service providers. It is also necessary for outsourcing partners to be equipped with vertical and functional specializations, with key differentiators customized to the Indian job scenario. In a recruitment market where the concept of full-time employment is increasingly becoming a thing of the past, temporary staffing is emerging as the viable option.</p>
